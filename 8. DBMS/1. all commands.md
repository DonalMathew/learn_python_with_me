Here’s a comprehensive guide to the basic MySQL commands that are essential for managing databases and performing various operations.

## Connecting to MySQL
- **Connect to MySQL server**: 
  ```sql
  mysql -u [username] -p
  ```
  (You will be prompted to enter your password)

## Database Commands
- **Show all databases**:
  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```
- **Create a new database**:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE [database-name];
  ```
- **Select a particular database**:
  ```sql
  USE [database-name];
  ```
- **Determine which database is currently in use**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DATABASE();
  ```

## Table Commands
- **Show all tables in the selected database**:
  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```
- **Describe the structure of a table**:
  ```sql
  DESCRIBE [table-name];
  ```
- **Create a new table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE [table-name] (
      column1 datatype,
      column2 datatype,
      ...
  );
  ```
- **Add a new column to a table**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE [table-name] ADD COLUMN [column-name] datatype;
  ```
- **Delete a column from a table**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE [table-name] DROP COLUMN [column-name];
  ```
- **Delete a table from the database**:
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE [table-name];
  ```

## Data Manipulation Commands
- **Insert a new record into a table**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO [table-name] (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
  ```
- **Select all records from a table**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM [table-name];
  ```
- **Select specific columns from a table**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM [table-name];
  ```
- **Update existing records in a table**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE [table-name] SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Delete specific records from a table**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM [table-name] WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Delete all records from a table without dropping it**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM [table-name];
  ```

## Additional Useful Commands
- **Truncate a table (remove all records)**:
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE [table-name];
  ```
- **Count the number of rows in a table**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [table-name];
   ```
- **Show current user and privileges**:
   ```sql
   SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER;
   ```

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how you might create a database, create a table within it, insert data, and query that data:

```sql
-- Create a new database called 'School'
CREATE DATABASE School;

-- Use the 'School' database
USE School;

-- Create a new table called 'Students'
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE
);

-- Insert data into the 'Students' table
INSERT INTO Students (FirstName, LastName, Age, EnrollmentDate) VALUES 
('John', 'Doe', 20, NOW()),
('Jane', 'Smith', 22, NOW());

-- Select all records from the 'Students' table
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

This guide covers fundamental MySQL commands that will help you perform basic operations on databases and tables effectively. For more advanced queries and operations, you can explore additional SQL clauses and functions.


## 5. **Nested Queries**
Using nested queries can also help in situations where JOINs become complex or when dealing with aggregates.

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT employee_id,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE orders.employee_id = employees.employee_id) AS order_count
FROM employees;
```
This counts the number of orders for each employee using a nested query.

## Conclusion
While JOINs are the most common method for selecting values from multiple tables in SQL, alternatives like UNION, subqueries, CTEs, OUTER APPLY, and nested queries offer flexibility and can improve query readability or performance in certain scenarios. Each method has its use cases and should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the query and the database design.
