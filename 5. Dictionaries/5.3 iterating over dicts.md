- iterating over keys:
```python
d = {
    "name":"Beej",
    1:2,
    "age":29
}

for k in d:
    print(f' key {k} has value {d[k]}')


# out:
#  key name has value Beej
#  key 1 has value 2
#  key age has value 29 
```


- iterating over values:
```python
students = {'John': 18, 'Mary': 19, 'Jane': 20} 

for age in students.values(): 
	print(age)
```
