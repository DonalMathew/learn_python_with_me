>Dictionaries are same as lists but in lists, it is not possible for anything other than a number to be the key.

- in case of lists:
    ```python
    x=[1,2,3]
    x[0]=1          #possible
    x["beej"]=1     #not possible
    ```
## Dictionary syntax 
```python
d={}

d = {
    "name":"Beej",
    1:2,
    "age":29
}

print(d["name"])    #beej
print(d[1])         #2
```
