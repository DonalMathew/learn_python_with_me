## Syntax
```python
x = "Beej!"
print(x[1:4]) # "eej"
```

## in-depth example
>since `strings` are immutable, slicing and reassigning the string to the same variable, makes the variable point to a new memory location with the sliced string as a `new string object`

>but slicing as a whole `(x[:])` will not create new object

```python
x="beej"
print(id(x)) #140388174083056

#slices as a whole and reassigns it
x=x[:]
print(id(x)) #140388174083056 [no change]

#slices and reassigns it
x=x[1:]
print(id(x)) #140388172121136 [changes]
```
