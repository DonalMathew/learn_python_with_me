# Immutable Datatypes
## (integer, float, string)
>All of these share a common
characteristic: they’re all immutable. (That is, you cannot change them. Note that you can always change
the thing a variable refers to—that is, you can assign the variable to refer to something else—but you can’t
change the immutable thing, itself.)

>In short, there’s no way to add something to the end of a string. You can take a string and add something
to it to make a completely new string with the new stuff on the end, but it’s a new string. The original is
never modified since it’s immutable.

```python
x = "hello"
print(id(x))    #139918594143152

x = x + " world"
print(id(x))    #139918591903792
```

### in-depth example [with string]:
```python
x = "hello"

print(x[2]) # print character 2, namely "l"

x[2] = "z" # ERROR! Python won't allow you to change the string!
```

- how to tackle the problem:
    ```python
    x = "hello"
    y = x[:2] + "z" + x[3:] # Make a new string
    print(y) # hezlo
    ```
