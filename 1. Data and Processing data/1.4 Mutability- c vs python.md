In C, the concept of mutable and immutable data types doesn't exist in the same way as in Python. However, you can achieve similar effects depending on how you declare and use variables and data structures. Here's a breakdown:

### **Mutable vs. Immutable in Python:**
- **Immutable:** Data types like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `tuple` are immutable in Python. Once created, their value cannot be changed.
- **Mutable:** Data types like `list`, `dict`, and `set` are mutable. You can modify their contents without creating a new object.

### **In C:**
C doesn't have built-in immutability for its basic data types. All basic data types in C are mutable in the sense that you can change the value stored in a variable. However, you can simulate immutability using certain techniques:

#### **1. Mutable Types (All Basic Types):**
All variables in C (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`, `array`, `struct`, etc.) are mutable:
- **Example:**
  ```c
  int x = 5;
  x = 10;  // You can directly change the value of x
  ```

#### **2. Simulating Immutability Using `const`:**
You can make a variable immutable by declaring it as `const`. A `const` variable cannot be modified after initialization.
- **Example:**
  ```c
  const int y = 5;
  y = 10;  // This will cause a compilation error because y is immutable
  ```

  - When using `const` with pointers, you can control whether the pointer itself, the data it points to, or both are immutable:
  
    ```c
    int x = 5;
    const int *ptr = &x;  // Data pointed to by ptr is immutable, but ptr itself can be changed
    *ptr = 10;  // Error: cannot modify the value pointed to by ptr
    ptr = &some_other_variable;  // This is allowed
    
    int * const ptr2 = &x;  // Pointer is immutable, but data pointed to is mutable
    *ptr2 = 10;  // This is allowed
    ptr2 = &some_other_variable;  // Error: cannot change the pointer itself
    ```

#### **3. Arrays and Structs:**
- **Arrays:** Arrays in C are mutable. You can change individual elements of an array.
  ```c
  int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
  arr[0] = 10;  // This is allowed, changing the first element of the array
  ```

- **Structs:** Structures (`struct`) are also mutable. You can modify the values of individual members unless they are declared `const`.
  ```c
  struct Point {
      int x;
      int y;
  };

  struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
  p1.x = 30;  // This is allowed, modifying a member of the struct
  ```

### **Summary:**
- **Mutable:** In C, by default, all variables and data types are mutable.
- **Simulating Immutability:** Use the `const` keyword to make variables, pointers, or data structures immutable.

C provides more control over memory and variable mutability at a lower level, but it doesn't have built-in immutable types like Python. Instead, immutability is enforced through the `const` keyword.
