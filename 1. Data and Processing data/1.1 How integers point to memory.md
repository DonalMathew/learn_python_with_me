>integers, strings


```python
y=1    
y=2   # 1 is not replaced by 2 in the same memory location, instead y now points to a different memory location containing the new integer object viz. 2
```

### comprehensive example
```python
x=1000
y=x

print(id(x))    #id=140457949640848
print((id(y)))  #id=140457949640848 (x and y points to same location)

print(y)    #1000

#-------------------------------------------------------

x=1001  # in this step, the memory pointed by x changes, and a new integer object(1001) is created

print(y)    #1000

print(id(x))    #id=140457949640880
print((id(y)))  #id=140457949640848 (no change)
```
