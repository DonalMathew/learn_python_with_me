```python
x="hello"
x[0]="j"        #not possible since strings are immutable


#in the same way, strings inside "lists of strings" are not mutable
x=["hello","hi"]
x[0][0]="j"         #not possible for string
print(x)            #error

x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
x[0][0]=99          #possible
print(x)            #[[99, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
