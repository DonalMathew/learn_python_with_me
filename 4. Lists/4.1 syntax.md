## Initialisation
```py
x=[]

x=[1,2,3]

print(x[0])     #1
print(x[-1])    #3
print(x[1:-1])  #[2]

y=x[0:-1]
print(y)        #[1,2]

print(id(x),id(y))          #both are different     
print(id(y[0]),id(x[0]))    #both are same
```
```python
x=["a","b"]
```

## Mutability
```python
#lists are mutable (unlike strings)
x[0]=99
print(x[0],y[0])    #both are different (i dont know why)

y=x
print(x[0],y[0])    #both are same
```
